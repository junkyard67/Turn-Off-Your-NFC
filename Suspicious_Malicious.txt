Hello Dear Friend!

If you find this file in your device then this means that you kept your NFC enabled while you were not using it!

What does this mean?
This means your device could have been hacked! Someone put this file in your device as a proof that you were vulnerable to a potential real attack.
This is file is not malicious, it is just a text file to inform you about one of the most common vulnerability: Human Error.

Do not worry, you are safe, this is not a real attack.

By keeping your device with NFC enabled, anyone who is able to create a NFC Tag with a web link could have made your device access a malicious link.
Malicious links can contain malware, resulting in your device being Remotely Controlled, your Information could have been stolen or you could have been a victim of a Ransomware.
By accessing such links, your device might just access and download the files without any notice.

Please keep your NFC disabled while not in use. This will keep you safe from potential malicious attackers.

For more information about the orgin of this file and the concept behind it you can visit https://github.com/junkyard67/Turn-Off-Your-NFC

To mitigate this vulnerability you can do the follwing, listed in the order of importance and impact:

1) Turn off your NFC while it's not used. This is the best and easiest method.
2) Don't have a default application to open links, always manually choose an application for such cases.
3) Don't have a default save option for downloading files, always manually choose where to download a file from the internet.
4) Keep your Device in a place where it would be hard for an Attacker to get close enought to launch this attack.

I recommend you to use all these mitigation steps at the same time.

This is Open Source Project and anyone can have access to it and can use it freely.

Please take care and be responsible!
